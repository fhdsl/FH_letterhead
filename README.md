This is a LaTeX version of the Fred Hutch letterhead for personal correspondence.

**How to use this template**

1. Clone the repository.
1. Edit the `hutch_letter_template.tex` file in an editor such as [TeXShop](https://sourceforge.net/projects/texshop.mirror/). Don't mess with `CL.cls` unless you know what you're doing.
1. Edit any personal information in the .tex file.
1. If you plan to use a signature in your letters, replace the signature.png file with a file containing your signature. Make sure the new file is also named "signature".
1. If you don't plan to use a signature, simply delete the line that says `\signature`.
